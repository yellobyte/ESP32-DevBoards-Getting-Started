## YB-ESP32-S3-ETH Development Board Overview:
The **YB-ESP32-S3-ETH** is a general purpose development board based on Espressif's ESP32-S3 MCU. It hosts an **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N8R8 module** with 8MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM, **RJ45 Ethernet connector**, an Ethernet PHY bridge chip **Wiznet W5500** and **two microUSB connectors** for software upload, serial output, debugging and feeding power to the board. The board is currently available on sales platforms [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125966982183) and [Ricardo.ch](https://www.ricardo.ch/de/s/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH).

Arduino libraries for the Wiznet W5500 are widely available (e.g. [**here**](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/)), enabling you to easily realise ESP32 projects around this board with Ethernet or even combined Ethernet/WLAN support.

The densly populated YB-ESP32-S3-ETH board provides [**multiple GPIO pins**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH_pinlayout.jpg) and is still [**highly breadboard compatible**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH_on_breadboard.jpg) for it leaves one row of accessible breadboard contacts on either side of the board. All I/O ports (GPIOx) are labeled on both sides of the board. 

If WLAN/BT is needed instead of or additionally to an Ethernet connection then an external 2.4GHz antenna can be connected to the onboard WROOM-1U module. The connector is compatible with the following standards: U.FL (Hirose), MHF-I (I-PEX) and AMC (Amphen). 

### YB-ESP32-S3-ETH board features:
 - ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N8R8 module with Espressif's modern ESP32-S3 MCU, 8MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM and WLAN/BT IPEX antenna connector
 - RJ45 10M/100M Ethernet connector driven by onboard PHY controller chip Wiznet W5500
 - The W5500 pins required to control the chip are hardwired to the ESP32-S3 GPIOs as follows:
   - *MOSI - GPIO11, MISO - GPIO13, SCK - GPIO12* (SPI bus data communication)
   - *SCS - GPIO14* (chip select, required for SPI bus control)
   - *RST - GPIO21* (chip reset, needed only for chip reset without resetting the whole board)  
   - *INT - GPIO18* (only if solder bridge on bottom is closed, seldomly needed)  
 - Two control LEDs. One LED labeled 'P' is connected to the 3.3V rail to indicate board power and the other LED labeled 'IO47' is connected to GPIO47 which can be used as status LED, for debugging purposes etc.
 - Two microUSB ports. One is connected to the ESP32-S3 directly for debugging or serial output (labeled 'USB') and the other via USB-TTL bridge chip CH340 (labeled 'UART') for serial output and software upload (e.g. via ArduinoIDE, VSCode/PlatformIO etc). The ESP32-S3 contains an inbuild JTAG adapter hence [**debugging**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/tree/main/debugging) via port 'USB' becomes fairly easy.
 - Hardware logic for *automatic* software uploads (supported by most Development IDEs) via microUSB port labeled 'UART'.  
 - Two pushbuttons. One is labeled 'R' and resets the ESP32-S3 (shorts EN pin to ground) and the other one is labeled 'B' and shorts GPIO0 to ground when pressed. The latter is needed under some circumstances for software upload (occasionally for the very first SW upload on new boards).  
 - Lots of available GPIOs next to the ones already mentioned above. Have a look at the boards [**pin layout**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH_pinlayout.jpg) and [**block diagram**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH_block_diagram.jpg) for more detailed hardware infos.
		
Detailed technical infos about Espressif's MCU ESP32-S3 and their ESP32-S3-WROOM-1(U) modules are provided [**here**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/tree/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc).

Just for information purposes: The ESP32-S3-WROOM-1(U) module family comprises several [**versions**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/ESP32-S3-WROOM-1(U)_Variants.jpg). The **-1** versions come with embedded PCB antenna, the **-1U** versions with IPEX antenna socket instead. The extension -Nx(Ry) defines the amount of available FLASH/PSRAM, e.g. -N4 (4MB Flash, no PSRAM), -N8 (8MB Flash, no PSRAM), -N8R2 (8 MB Flash and 2MB PSRAM), -N8R8 (8 MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM) etc.  

## Powering the board:
The board uses a LDO to drop the external supply voltage (5VDC min.) and internally operates on 3.3Volt. There are three (mutually exclusive) ways to provide power to the board.
  - through the microUSB ports
  - 5...9VDC applied to the VIN pin
  - 3.3VDC applied to the 3V3 pin(s)  

Normal operating current of the board (equipped with ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R8, all GPIOs unconnected, Ethernet Link up) is about 180mA. Without attached Ethernet cable the current drops to about 120mA.

## Application hints:
At the time of this writing most development IDEs support the Espressif32 platform including ESP32-S3/C3 boards, e.g. the popular Espressif ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 board. Selecting this board will produce code which runs flawlessly on the standard YB-ESP32-S3-ETH (-N8R8) board, incl. SPI/I2C port settings. The only major issue is the not accessible PSRAM.

 Therefore each provided software example comes with a subdirectory *'boards'* in it's root directory. There lie the specific board definition files (yb-esp32-s3-eth-n...json) that provide the build environment with the proper board definitions & settings.  
 
Going a step further and putting these files to your development platforms *core_dir/platforms/espressif32/boards* directory (on my PC it's  *C:\Users\name\\.platformio\platforms\espressif32\boards*) means you can now create a new project in PlatformIO and simply select this board from the pull-down list.  

 ![](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/doc/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH_PlatformIO_board_selection.jpg)

 Then in *platformio.ini* you'll have the setting **board = yb-esp32-s3-eth-n8r8** and voilÃ , the 8MB PSRAM are available as well. Have a look at the provided example [Test-ESP32-S3-ETH-RAM-PSRAM](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/examples/Test-ESP32-S3-ETH-RAM-PSRAM) for more detailed infos to PSRAM usage.

The MicroUSB socket labeled 'USB' is wired directly to the ESP32-S3 MCU (GPIO19/GPIO20). Therefore when the development board gets resetted a PC/Laptop connected to this port might temporarily lose connection (the associated COM port will disappear for a second or two). This can confuse some terminal programs.  

With both MicroUSB ports connected simultaneously you will see 2 COM ports and an additional usb device "USB JTAG/serial debug unit". How to use this device for debugging is explained in detail [**here**](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/tree/main/debugging).

Serial output generated with Serial.print() can be directed either to port **'USB'** or port **'UART'**. A single build flag in platformio.ini defines the USB port it goes to:
- **ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0**, serial output goes to **UART**
- **ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1**, serial output goes to **USB**

The PlatformIO builder scripts (*.json) for modules containing ESP32-S3/C3 already define the build flag _ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1_. It disables the USB-OTG mode. If not or you want to override it you can (re-)define it in your platformio.ini control file. Normally you don't have to worry about it.
   
### First Software Upload to new boards:
The ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U modules put onto the dev boards during production are often not initialized. Attempting a SW upload with an IDE using the (reset & upload) hardware logic on port 'UART' will then mostly fail. A serial monitor (Speed setting: 115200Bd) connected to 'UART' only shows this:

```
ESP-ROM:esp32s3-20210327
23:10:07.248 > Build:Mar 27 2021
23:10:07.251 > rst:0x7 (TG0WDT_SYS_RST),boot:0x8 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
23:10:07.256 > Saved PC:0x40049087
23:10:07.256 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
23:10:07.259 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
23:10:07.262 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
23:10:07.262 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
....
....
```
The second USB port on the dev board, labeled 'USB', is not functional as well for the ESP32-S3 hasn't been initialized yet. Remember: 'USB'' is directly attached to the ESP32-S3 chip.

In this scenario the **ESP32-S3 has to be put manually into upload mode** by keeping the **'B'** button pressed, pressing/releasing the **'R'** button shortly and then finally releasing the **'B'** button. The serial monitor connected to port 'UART' will confirm the boards readiness:  

```
....
23:19:07.143 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
23:19:07.147 > invalid header: 0xffffffff
23:19:07.453 > ESP-ROM:esp32s3-20210327
23:19:07.453 > Build:Mar 27 2021
23:19:07.453 > rst:0x1 (POWERON),boot:0x0 (DOWNLOAD(USB/UART0))
23:19:07.459 > waiting for download
```
Now the dev board is ready to get flashed for the very first time. Below the log of flashing the dev board with provided software example [Test-ESP32-S3-ETH-DHCP](https://github.com/yellobyte/ESP32-DevBoards-Getting-Started/raw/main/boards/YB-ESP32-S3-ETH(YelloByte)/examples/Test-ESP32-S3-ETH-DHCP).

## Remarks:  
- Only after successfully flashing the board for the first time will the port labeled 'USB' be fully operational.  
- In very rare cases I couldn't get any serial output at all on USB/UART right after flashing. Resetting the board by pressing the reset button 'R' always fixed the problem.
- Some YB-ESP32-S3-ETH boards will be delivered already flashed with provided software example 'Test-ESP32-S3-ETH-DHCP'. In this case the blue status LED will blink when power is applied and the board is already capable of automatic SW uploads via your selected IDE (pressing buttons not required).
