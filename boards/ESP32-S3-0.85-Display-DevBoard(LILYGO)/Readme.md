The Lilygo "T-QT" ESP32-S3 development board features a 0.85" LCD color display (128x128 pixels, driver IC GC9107), a battery connector, USB-C socket, 8MB Flash, GPIO pins and WiFi/BT.

**Important:**
1) The USB-C socket is connected directly to the ESP32-S3 chip. Therefore when resetting the board with the little switch located at the side of the board your PC/Laptop will temporarily lose connection (the associated COM port will disappear for a second or two). This might confuse some terminal programs.
2) Without build option ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1 you will not get any serial output generated with Serial.println() etc. Without this option you will only get debug output generated by debug levels > 0.
3) As of TFT_eSPI lib version 2.4.79 there is a problem with screen to CGRAM offset for LILYGO T-QT with 0.85" display. After building the example "Test-ESP32-S3-0.85inch_tft" for the first time please replace file ".pio\libdeps\ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1\TFT_eSPI\TFT_Drivers\GC9A01_Rotation.h" with provided file GC9A01_Rotation.h.
