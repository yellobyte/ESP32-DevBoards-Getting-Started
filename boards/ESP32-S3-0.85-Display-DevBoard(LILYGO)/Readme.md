The Lilygo "T-QT" ESP32-S3 development board features a 0.85" LCD color display (128x128 pixels, driver IC GC9107), a battery connector, USB-C socket, 8MB Flash, GPIO pins and WiFi.

**Important:**
1) The USB-C socket is connected directly to the ESP32-S3 chip. Therefore when resetting the board with the little switch located at the side of the board your PC/Laptop will temporarily lose connection (the associated COM port will disappear for a second or two). This might confuse some terminal programs.
2) Without build option ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1 you will not get any serial output generated with Serial.println() etc. Without this option you will only get debug output generated by debug levels > 0.
