The ESP32-DevKit-V1 development board is a low-footprint and entry-level development board that is part of Espressif's ESP32 DevKit development board series and has been available for some years now. 
Lots of almost identical China clones (2x15pin, 2x19pin, etc.) for small money can be bought everywhere, which makes it the perfect board to start playing with the ESP32 universe.
